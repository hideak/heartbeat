Heartbeat Sensor Webapp
=======================

## Introduction

This is a simple static webpage created to test a simple idea of providing an interface that can measure your heartbeat using the camera of your notebook or mobile device.

After placing your finger on your device's camera, a color filter will be applied to the image and only the intensity of the red color will be tracked. After keeping the finger in place for around 10 seconds, the measured heartbeat (in Beats per Minute, BPM) will stabilize and you will see its value on the screen.

## Measurement Accuracy

This application is, in fact, pretty inaccurate, as it only uses camera data along with a simple image filter to evaluate the heartbeat. But we still can use it as a simple test or just for fun!
